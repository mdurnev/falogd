falogd - Log system wide file access events


Log Format
----------

process_name(pid<parent_pid<parent_parent_pid<...<1): access path

For example:
test(19069<19060<3749<3747<3689<3682<1): RCO /bin/bash
falog-ctrl(19067<19060<3749<3747<3689<3682<1): RCO /bin/bash

All Process IDs are unique in the log. Reused PIDs are loged as: PID + (reuse_count << 16).
So the following IDs belong to different processes with the same PID: 19069, 84605, 150141, 
215677, 281213, ...
ID uniqueness is broken if reuse count is 65536 or greater.


Examples
--------

# Start the daemon
sudo ./falogd

# Log only file read events (default is "ORWCD", i.e. open, read, write and close 
# events for files and directories)
./falog-ctrl events "R"

# Log only access to files which path contains "sysroots/mx6q" or "/temp/run.do_"
# and does not contain "foo"
./falog-ctrl filter "sysroots/mx6q"
./falog-ctrl filter "/temp/run.do_"
./falog-ctrl filter "!foo"

# Save log to a file
./falog-ctrl print > log.txt

# Clean up all logs and filters
./falog-ctrl reset

# Stop the daemon
./falog-ctrl quit
